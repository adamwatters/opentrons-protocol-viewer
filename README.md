# OpenTrons Protocol

### [Demo](https://rawgit.com/adamwatters/opentrons-protocol-viewer/master/build/index.html)

## Notes

### Purpose:
- Users should have a visual reference of deck and containers when creating or viewing protocol

### Technical Requirements:
- Deck components should be flexible => different deck sizes and configurations should be possible

- Container components should be flexible => container renderer should not be tied to existing container descriptions

- App should register and log sequential clicks between container addresses

- App should be able to replay sequence of container addresses
